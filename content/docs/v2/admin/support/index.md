If you checked everything in [Troubleshooting](/admin/troubleshooting) and it still does not work, create a new Issue on GitHub or send an email to [tfsaggregator@outlook.com](mailto:tfsaggregator@outlook.com?subject=Support Request). Please add any useful information like:

 * Aggregator version
 * TFS version or VSTS
 * Content of your `TFSAggregator2.ServerPlugin.policies` file (e.g. save it on <https://gist.github.com/> and copy the link in the Issue)
 * Definition of your work item types (use [witadmin exportwitd](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd312129.aspx))

If you built the assemblies yourselves, they take a fixed `2.0.0.0` version. Please report, the source code version (Tag or commit SHA) used to build your binaries.
