## Web Service

> The Web Service is **deprecated**, use [Aggregator CLI](/docs/v3) instead.

Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) and TFS (2015 and later) can integrate with other systems through [Service hooks](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/integrate/get-started/service-hooks/get-started).
TFS Aggregator Web Service leverage the [Web Hooks](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/integrate/get-started/service-hooks/services/webhooks) variant
to receive notifications of work items changes in VSTS/TFS.

The common scenario is:

 1. A user changes some work item's data using Visual Studio or TFS Web Interface, then presses the **Save** button (or hits `Ctrl-S`);
 2. VSTS/TFS validates the edit and saves the changes to the database;
 3. VSTS/TFS call the Aggregator Web Service using HTTPS, the message contains information on the type of change, the instance, project and work item;
 4. Aggregator see which Rules apply and execute them, which may call back the loading additional work items;
 5. Aggregator calls back VSTS/TFS using HTTPS to save any changed work item.

Note that steps 3 and 5 requires authentication.

## Server Plugin

The following diagram may help understand the control flow.

 1. A user changes some work item's data using Visual Studio or TFS Web Interface, then presses the **Save** button (or hits `Ctrl-S`);
 2. TFS validates the edit and saves the changes to the database;
 3. TFS notifies the Aggregator plugin of the *ID* of the changed work item
 4. Aggregator see which Rules apply and execute them, which may cause the loading and saving of additional work items.

> Note that step 4 may trigger Aggregator again on the just saved work items.

Keep also in mind that scripts and applications can change work items without user intervention, like [Team Foundation Server Integration Tools](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/eb77e739-c98c-4e36-9ead-fa115b27fefe). Make sure that TFS Aggregator kicks in only when intended.


## Configuration changes

Aggregator loads and parses the Rules from `TFSAggregator2.ServerPlugin.policies` file at first run. The result is cached in memory and the cache invalidates if the file changes.
