The source for documentation is [tfsaggregator-docs-hugo](https://github.com/tfsaggregator/tfsaggregator-docs-hugo).
Note that you need to pull down also the theme submodule.

The `master` branch content must match the latest release.
To prepare documentation for a future release, use a branch as in the code repository.

Get [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) Hugo v0.18.1.


Run `hugo server` to test the changes locally.
