## Build

Building locally requires
- Visual Studio 2019 with .Net Core 3.1 SDK
- Azure Functions and Web Jobs Tools



## Debug


### Custom/development Aggregator runtime

In Visual Studio, `src\aggregator-function\Directory.Build.targets` will automatically package and copy the runtime needed by CLI.
You might have to change the version number in `src\aggregator-function\aggregator-manifest.ini` to force your local version.

You can also use the *Pack* right-click command on the `aggregator-function` project and make sure to copy the created zip into your CLI directory so it uploads the correct one when creating an instance.


### CLI

Set `aggregator-cli` as Start-up project
Use the Visual Studio Project properties to set the Command line arguments.


### Debug Aggregator Runtime locally

Open **aggregator-cli.sln** in Visual Studio.  
Set `aggregator-function` as the Start-up project.  
Start the project in Debug mode (hit F5).  
Create a folder with the same name as the rule, e.g. `test1`.  
Add to the folder a file with the same name and suffix `.rule`, `test1.rule` in this example, with the code you want to test, e.g.

```csharp
$"Hello { self.WorkItemType } #{ self.Id } - { self.Title }!"
```

Add to the folder a file named `function.json` with this
```json
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "type": "httpTrigger",
      "direction": "in",
      "webHookType": "genericJson",
      "name": "req"
    },
    {
      "type": "http",
      "direction": "out",
      "name": "res"
    }
  ],
  "disabled": false
}
```

Add to the folder a file named `run.csx` with this content:
```csharp
#r "../bin/aggregator-function.dll"
#r "../bin/aggregator-shared.dll"

using aggregator;

public static async Task<object> Run(HttpRequestMessage req, ILogger logger, ExecutionContext context)
{
    var handler = new AzureFunctionHandler(logger, context);
    return await handler.Run(req);
}
```

Set a breakpoint.  
Send the request message at http://localhost:7071/api/test1 using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) or similar tool.

The Function should log a similar sequence of trace messages.

### Debug Aggregator Runtime (live Azure Function)


#### View live Aggregator log messages

In Azure Portal, open the Resource Group hosting the Instance (`aggregator-` followed by name of instance).
Open the App Service hosting the Instance (instance name followed by `aggregator`).
Switch to the **Platform features** tab and click on _Log streaming_ like in the picture.

## Integration tests

Integration tests emulate a user running Aggregator CLI.

These tests require configuration data in `src/integrationtests-cli/logon-data.json` to connect to Azure and Azure DevOps and run the tests.
