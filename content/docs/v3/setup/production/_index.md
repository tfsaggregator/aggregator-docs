# Production Configuration and Administration


## Control performance and costs

You can specify the size for the Virtual machine running the rules using the `hostingPlanSku` and `hostingPlanTier` options. The defaults are **Y1**/**Dynamic**, known as [Consumption plan](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-scale#consumption-plan). You can select a [Premium plan](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-scale#premium-plan) instead, like **Premium**/**P2V2** for example.


## Production monitoring

[Disable built-in logging](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-monitoring#disable-built-in-logging) and use Application Insights.
Build-in log streaming is useful only for developers as it may skip or duplicate messages as in this picture.

## Troubleshooting

Use the Application Insight instance that was created aside the Azure Function.


## Renew Azure DevOps Personal Access Token (PAT)

Azure DevOps Personal Access Token (PAT) expires and is up to the administrator to renew or replace them.
Aggregator stores the PAT in the Azure Function configuration, allowing the rules to access Azure DevOps. You should refresh the PAT before expires or save a new PAT in Aggregator configuration using the `configure.instance` command.
