TFS Aggregator is a extension for Team Foundation Server (TFS) and Azure DevOps Server (**not Service!**) that enables running custom script when Work Items change, allowing dynamic calculation of field values in TFS and more.

## Any TFS

You can use the Server Plugin, for TFS 2013 update 2 up to Azure DevOps Server 2019 Update 1.

> TFS Server API changes frequently: the Server Plugin contains specific code for each TFS version, so the binaries will work only with a specific TFS version. The Web Service has not such a problem.
